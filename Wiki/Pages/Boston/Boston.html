            This is where my military journey ends. I have been in the military since 25 June 2015 and will get out on 24 July 2024. The past 9 years have been more fulfilling, joyful, 
            but also incredibly challenging at times. Going into the Air Force Academy, I would have never thought I would be a program manager, turned into software engineer. I wanted to
            be a pilot or special operator, but the universe had different plans for me. And I wouldn't trade the peeople I met, the experiences I had, or the time spend for anything.
